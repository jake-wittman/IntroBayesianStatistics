abstract = {Emerald ash borer is an invasive beetle causing significant mortality of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in North America and western Russia. The invasive range has expanded to more than half of the states in the United States since the initial detection in Michigan, USA in 2002. Emerald ash borer is typically managed with a combination of techniques including surveys/trapping, insecticide treatments, host tree removal, biological control, and public education/outreach. The insect's rapid spread rate and cryptic life history and a lack of resistance among most North American Fraxinus spp. have limited opportunities to gather empirical data on how aggressive tree removal may slow population growth in isolated, satellite infestations if detected early. An early detection of an isolated population of emerald ash borer in 2009 in Minnesota, USA was managed by using a selective host-tree removal program (i.e., sanitation). Trees were preferentially removed based on the assumption that evidence of woodpecker foraging (i.e., pecking) was a good indicator of infestation by emerald ash borer. Extensive sampling and survey data on larval densities and the presence/absence of pecking on ash trees in a 6-km2 area for the Twin Cities, Minnesota were used to parameterize a model of population growth over the next four years. We found that removing ∼63{\%} of the total trees across four years reduced the cumulative number of beetles produced in the core infested area by ∼54{\%}. However, we also found that increases in efficacy, i.e., larger decreases in beetle production per removed tree, could be achieved by preferentially removing trees with pecking. The invasive range of emerald ash borer in North America and western Russia continues to expand via natural and human-aided dispersal. While silvicultural control tactics alone will not be an adequate management strategy, tree removal is an important component of both a broader pest management program and the systematic replacement of ash canopies in urban forests. Increasing understanding of the efficacy of different management techniques in slowing population growth of emerald ash borer will be useful to support decision–making by land managers.},

As of autumn 2011, A. planipennis has been detected in 15 US states and two Canadian provinces. A pilot project to slow the onset and progression of ash mortality, termed SLAM (SLow Ash Mortality), has been implemented in localized A. planipennis populations. Here we use spatially explicit simulations to evaluate the potential of a recently developed systemic insecticide to protect the ash resource in urban forests as a component of the SLAM approach. Over a 10-year horizon, simulations showed ash survival varied depending on: (i) how soon insecticide treatment began after the A. planipennis introduction; (ii) the proportion of trees treated; and (iii) the distribution of treated trees relative to the A. planipennis introduction point.

@article{Muirhead2006,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Limiting the damage by non-indigenous species requires rapid determination of current and potential distributions and vectors of dispersal, and development of appropriate management measures. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), a wood-boring beetle native to South-East Asia, was first reported in the Great Lakes region during summer 2002. The beetle poses an enormous threat to native ash (Fraxinus) species of North America, as untreated trees in infested areas of Ontario, Michigan and Ohio suffer high mortality. We demonstrate that the borer has spread in North America through a combination of diffusive range extension, associated with local flights, and by long-distance ‘jump' dispersal associated with human movement of infested sapling or contaminated firewood. Probability of infestation was inversely related to distance from borer epicentres but positively related to the size of human population centres. At least 9 of 39 populations that were first reported in Michigan during 2004 cannot be accounted for by local diffusion, raising the possibility that other unidentified mechanisms may be contributing to the dispersal of the beetle. In the absence of quarantine, by 2005 all of Michigan's lower peninsula was contained within the boundaries of potential diffusive range expansion. Infested ash saplings also were introduced from Michigan to Maryland during 2003, and subsequently transplanted to five sites in Maryland and Virginia. Quarantine and eradication measures have had mixed results: in the south-central USA, the species appears on the brink of eradication, whereas its distribution has continued to spread during 2005 in the Great Lakes region despite extensive containment and quarantine measures. Quarantine success in the Great Lakes region is encumbered by multiple dispersal vectors, larger borer population sizes and by the more extensive geographical distribution that was achieved prior to implementation of control measures.},

abstract = {Aim: To develop an approach to model the spatial dynamics of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in European Russia. This tree-killing pest was detected in Moscow 15 years ago and began to spread, posing a threat to ashes all over Europe. The aim was to determine its probable current range and to evaluate the probability of its dispersal to neighboring countries within the next 5 years. Location: Cities and transport hubs of European Russia and neighboring countries. Ash trees in this region occur mainly in urban plantations and along highways. Methods: Pairwise distances between all locations were used as the main parameter determining the probability of pest spread. For each location, the probability of detection of A. planipennis was calculated using three simulation recurrent models of long-distance dispersal. Parametrization was made by comparison with results of surveys in 2003-2015. Field data on the range of A. planipennis in 2016-2017 were mapped and used for model verification. A prognosis of spread of the pest by 2022 was made. Results: A model based on fat-tailed kernel corresponds to both negative and positive results of surveys. According to the model, the current range is likely to be restricted to Russia, but probability of detection of the pest in the east of Belarus, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by 2022 is 15{\%}-40{\%}. Main conclusions: The forestry services of neighboring countries probably have about 5 years to prepare for the invasion of this pest, but regular surveys are necessary , since the pest can appear at any time. The case considered shows that the simple approach based on a fat-tailed kernel and just one parameter-pairwise distance between cities-can be used for modeling long-distance dispersal of alien pests of urban plantations.

@article{Sobek-Swant2012,
abstract = {We use two ecological niche modeling methods, Maxent and GARP, to model the potential distribution of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, EAB) in its invaded (Canada, USA) and native range (eastern Asia). For each algorithm (Maxent and GARP), we constructed three different models based on native or invaded data or a combination thereof. All GARP models yielded higher area under the curve (AUC) values and had therefore higher discriminatory power than the corresponding Maxent models, and the area predicted as suitable by GARP in North America was generally larger and included most infested sites even at the known range edges. In Asia, habitat suitability predicted by both algorithms was low and models trained with invaded coordinates did not transfer well to the native range. We found that none of the Maxent models provided a prediction precise enough for reliable risk assessment and the development of management plans, but a GARP model trained in the native range performed well when validated with data from the invaded range. Based on this GARP model, EAB may be able to extend its North American range further south, north and west covering roughly half (49{\%}) of the natural range of the most common affected ash species (Fraxinus americana, F. nigra, F. quadrangulata, and F. pennsylvanica). While our results demonstrate that native data may be useful for risk assessment of invasive species, a validation of early predictions based on these data is only possible with a time lag, which is lacking for most species. Due to uncertainties associated with ecological niche models for invaders, native data may not be sufficient at all times for long-term risk assessment. With regard to the latter, we recommend frequent re-evaluation of models based on more current monitoring. Combining ecological niche models with more mechanistic approaches based on experimental data may reduce uncertainty and improve risk assessment.},

abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferen- tial statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condi- tion. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to drawsweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to con- sider thegeneralizability ofone's conclusionsfroma statistical perspective lies at the root ofmany of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

abstract = {Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), a phloem-feeding beetle native to Asia, was discovered near Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario in 2002. As of March 2009, isolated populations of emerald ash borer (EAB) have been detected in nine additional states and Quebec. EAB is a highly invasive forest pest that has the potential to spread and kill native ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) throughout the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of ash treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25-state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009–2019). An estimated 38million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 17million ash trees with mean discounted cost of {\$}10.7billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside, as well as inside, communities nearly double the estimates of the number of ash trees treated or removed and replaced, and the associated cost. The estimates of discounted cost suggest that a substantial investment might be efficiently spent to slow the expansion of isolated EAB infestations and postpone the ultimate costs of ash treatment, removal, and replacement.},

As it continues to spread, it could functionally extirpate ash with devastating economic and ecological impacts. Little was known about EAB when it was first discovered in North America in 2002, but substantial advances in understanding of EAB biology, ecology, and management have occurred since. Ash species indigenous to China are generally resistant to EAB and may eventually provide resistance genes for introgression into North American species. EAB is characterized by stratified dispersal resulting from natural and human-assisted spread, and substantial effort has been devoted to the development of survey methods. Early eradication efforts were abandoned largely because of the difficulty of detecting and delineating infestations. Current management is focused on biological control, insecticide protection of high-value trees, and integrated efforts to slow ash mortality.},
